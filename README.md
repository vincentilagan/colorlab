# ColorLab - Cinematic LAB LUT Generator

Hi! I’m Vincent Ilagan, a filmmaker and the creator of **ColorLab**.

I made this tool specifically for my personal film projects, especially for color grading. With my film deadline coming up soon, I quickly built this to speed up my workflow in applying cinematic color grading using LAB color space and LUTs.

---

## Why I created this

- To easily apply custom cinematic color grading across different computers, especially when I’m away from my main setup.
- To help other filmmakers and artists who want a simple tool to generate LUTs and preview color grading effects before saving.
- To save time and speed up the color grading process.

## How to use

1. Select your **Target Image** (the look or color grade you want to match).
2. Select your **Source Image** (the original footage or photo you want to recolor).
3. Choose the **Output Folder** where the `.cube` LUT file will be saved.
4. Click **Generate LUT & Preview** to instantly see the effect applied to your source image.
5. Once satisfied, click **Save LUT** to export the `.cube` file.
6. Import the `.cube` LUT into After Effects, Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or any editor that supports LUTs.

## Notes

- This tool was built quickly but is open to anyone who wants to improve or contribute.
- I hope this helps you in your creative projects and filmmaking.
- Feel free to send feedback or pull requests if you want to enhance it!

This tool uses the LAB color space for color transfer based on mean and standard deviation statistics of both target and source images. The color mapping uses a 3D LUT to apply this transfer, which can be imported into popular video editing and color grading software.
